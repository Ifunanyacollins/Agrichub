      '-Store stems 2-5 days for sprouting -cut stems to lengths of 25cm with sharp knife â€“vertical or angular planting during high rainfall-horizontal planting during low rainfall.',
    Fertilizerrequirement:
      'With the right soil, no need for fertilizer -on poor soil, cow dung, poultry droppings can be used to enrich the soil - NPK fertilizer should be applied 15-45cm away from stem base in holes',

    Symptoms:
      'spots on leaf, reduced leaf size, premature leaf drop, candlestick-like stem, bore through plant & eating plant up',
    Control:
      'use resistant variety, remove dead woods, grasses, destroy ant hills, spray Gamalin 20 & D-Aldrex 20',

    Harvestingmethods:
      'the stem is reduced to about 25cm, then the cassava is pulled out when the soil is wet. In dry soil, hoes, cutlasses & diggers are used.The stem must be cut very low when using machines for easy movement',

  Processingstorage: {
    Reasonforprocessing:
      'to increase shelf life of roots, prevent spoilage or food loss, to remove the toxic compounds in cassava, to create varieties of foods with acceptable taste, aroma and texture, to produce industrial raw materials',
    Productsincludes:
      'garri, abacha, fufu, flour, starch & animal feed. From flour we get noodle, puff-puff, chin-chin, pies, bread, biscuit, glucose syrup, adhesives and bioethanol',

  },
  Marketing:
    '-Cassava & its various products are commonly sold to retailers in the village markets at cheaper rates. They in turn convert them to other food products , package & resale them in the towns at higher rates.-about 10% of cassava are converted to animal feed, starch & ethanol & traded internationally.',
  Economicimportance:
    '-cassava as a major staple food contributes to the dietary requirement of all Nigerians. Exportation of cassava & its products generates revenue & creates job opportunities',
